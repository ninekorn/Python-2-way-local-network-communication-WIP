# Python-2-way-local-network-communication-WIP

developped by steve chassé

i have developped a python 2 way communicator scripts for having the screen capture of my virtual desktop program SCCoreSystems to be sent to my kali OS installation on my raspberri pi 4B which is the current dedicated logic board circuit of my virtual reality headset idea. The contents of the folders are the scripts i was learning on and testing on for that coding challenge, to make me able to learn how network wifi was working for sending the image of the screencapture to the raspberry pi 4b, but prior to that, the jetson nano. 

Related to passing an image from a device to another device, i have some code setuped in my repo https://github.com/ninekorn/sccs/tree/main/tests with my solution called sccoresystems-arduino-controllers in the script SC_update.cs or sc_graphics_sec.cs where i prepared an array of bytes for sending the sharpdx screencapture from C# to an arduino device but i wasn't done yet. I will provide the python script i had developped to receive the image on the arduino device very soon.
